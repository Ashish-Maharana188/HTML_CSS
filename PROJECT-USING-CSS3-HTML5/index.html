            <ul class="pagecontent">
                <li><strong>1913</strong>- Albert Camus was born in a working-class neighbourhood in Mondovi, in French
                    Algeria. </li>
                <li><strong>1930</strong> - Diagnosed with tuberculosis. </li>
                <li><strong>1933</strong> - Camus enrolled at the University of Algiers and completed his licence de
                    philosophie (BA) in 1936</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hié, later married her and divorced
                    her cause of an affair she had with her personal doctor</li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong>- Joined French Communist Party. Camus left the FCP after a year.</li>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> - The independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded, and
                    Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so.His main role was to organise
                    <i>Théâtre du Travail</i> (Worker's Theatre) which he later renamed to <i>Théâtre de l'Equipe</i>
                    ("Theatre of the Team").</li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Began working for a leftist newspaper <i>Alger républicain</i>(founded by
                    Pascal Pia) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was
                    worrying him.</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong> - Camus flew to Paris, took a new job as editor-in-chief he almost completed
                    his "first cycle" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless—the novel <i>L'Étranger (The
                        Outsider (UK)</i>, or <i>The Stranger (US)</i>, the philosophical essay <i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe
                        (The Myth of Sisyphus)</i> and the play <i>Caligula</i>. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an
                    essay and a theatrical play. Soon after he moved, outbreak of World War II began to affect France.
                    Married a pianist Francine Faure on 3 December 1940 and flew back to Algeria where he taught in
                    primary schools and began working on his second cycle of works.</li>
                <li><strong>1943</strong> - By he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he
                    met and became friends with Jean-Paul Sartre. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals
                    including Simone de Beauvoir, André Breton, and others.</li>
                <li.<strong>1944</strong> - He founded <i>the Comité français pour la féderation européenne</i>—(CFFE
                    (French Committee for the European Federation))—declaring that Europe "can only evolve along the
                    path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation."
                    <li><strong>1947-1948</strong> - He founded the <i>Groupes de Liaison Internationale</i> (GLI) a
                        trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (<i>syndicalisme
                            révolutionnaire</i>). His main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and
                        existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of André Breton. Camus also raised his
                        voice against the Soviet intervention in Hungary and the totalitarian tendencies of Franco's
                        regime in Spain.</li>
                    <li><strong>1957</strong> - He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. At age 44, he was the
                        second-youngest recipient of the prize, after Rudyard Kipling, who was 42.</li>
                    <li><strong>1960</strong> - Camus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near
                        Sens, in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of Villeblevin.</li>
                    <p> There has been speculation that Camus was assassinated by the KGB because of his criticism of
                        Soviet abuses.144 pages of a handwritten manuscript entitled Le premier Homme (The First Man)
                        were found in the wreckage. Camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his
                        childhood in Algeria would be his finest work. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery,
                        Vaucluse, France, where he had lived.His friend Sartre read a eulogy, paying tribute to Camus's
                        heroic "stubborn humanism". William Faulkner wrote his obituary, saying, "When the door shut for
                        him he had already written on this side of it that which every artist who also carries through
                        life with him that one same foreknowledge and hatred of death, is hoping to do: I was here."</p>
